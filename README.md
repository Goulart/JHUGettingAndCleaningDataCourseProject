### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

Please read the Code Book (CodeBook.md) for info on the data and transformations applied.

The original data came from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The (only) script is run_analysis.R and it:
- Requires the data to be unziped to a folder
- Requires the package dplyr
- Reads in the files, applies all transformations, and writes out the "stats" file for submission
